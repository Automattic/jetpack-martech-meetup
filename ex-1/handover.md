## Current Status
- Whatâ€™s working:
    - The components have been updated to functional components and moved to their own file
    - Classname calculations were made clearer in the Button component
## Critical Next Steps
1. Prop validation
2. Double-check for styling inconsistencies
## Known Issues/Blockers

## Context for Decisions
- Why we chose this approach:
  - We chose not to change the class name of the Button component because after separating classes into their own functions made it clearer and the different class name types have the same naming convention among themselves.
