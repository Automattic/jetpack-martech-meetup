# Challenge 1: Technical Debt Hunt - "The Component Library"
## Scenario
Your team has inherited a component library with inconsistent styling patterns, naming conventions, and performance issues. Each "timezone" will work on improving different aspects of the codebase.

## Suggested Improvements by "Timezone"
Each timezone should focus on specific improvements and clearly document their changes for the next team:

### Timezone 1:
- Analyze the codebase and identify the most critical styling issues
- Start with the Button component - fix inconsistent class naming
- Begin converting to functional components with hooks
- Document styling inconsistencies found

### Timezone 2:
- Continue modernization to functional components
- Fix CSS specificity issues in the Card component
- Establish consistent naming conventions across components
- Implement proper prop validation
